# Environment Variables (Optional)
# Copy this file to .env.local and update with your values

# Contract Address (after deployment)
# NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000

# Network Configuration (Optional)
# NEXT_PUBLIC_NETWORK_NAME=sepolia
# NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAIN_ID=11155111

# Note: These are optional. The app works with hardcoded values in utils/contract.js
# Use environment variables for production deployments where you want to:
# 1. Keep contract address out of source control
# 2. Use different contracts for different environments
# 3. Deploy to multiple networks

# To use environment variables:
# 1. Uncomment the lines above
# 2. Update utils/contract.js to use process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS
# 3. Add these to Vercel environment variables in project settings
